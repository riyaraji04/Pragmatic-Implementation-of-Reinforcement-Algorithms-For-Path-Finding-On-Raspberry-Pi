# Pragmatic-Implementation-of-Reinforcement-Algorithms-For-Path-Finding-On-Raspberry-Pi
The proposed system is a cost-efficient approach that is implemented to facilitate a Raspberry Pi controlled four-wheel drive non-holonomic robot map a grid. This approach computes and navigates the shortest path from a source key point to a destination key point to carry out the desired delivery. Q learning and Deep-Q learning are used to find the optimal path while avoiding collision with static obstacles. This work defines an approach to deploy these two algorithms on a robot. A novel algorithm to decode an array of directions into accurate movements in a certain action space is also proposed. The procedure followed to dispatch this system with the said requirements is described, ergo presenting the proof of concept for indoor autonomous delivery vehicles.<br>
